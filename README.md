Josh Nimoy mentioned openFrameworks in his Tron Legacy post  So why not try it myself. After some pointers from arturo I managed to get these smooth gradient arcs.  Using the FBO and ofMesh from the upcoming openFrameworks 0.7 release. Running super smooth on macbook.

Some people asked about the license it's BSD (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). So you can do whatever you want with it. 
It's always nice to see what other people do with it so I would be more than happy if you send me picture.
